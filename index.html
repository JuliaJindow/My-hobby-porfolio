    <p id="p1">My hobby is reading. Reading is my favorite activity. When I get some free time after my studies,I go and read my books.I love my books very much reading books is my favorite past time. On every evening, I have about a few hours free. Mostly, I read my favorite books at that time. I also have a variety of books written by many authors.I love to read all my books but, the other books are not my favorite comparing them with the books written by my favotrite authors.
